## `RColorBrewer`

```r
library("RColorBrewer")
display.brewer.all()
```
- Sequential palettes (first list of colors), which are suited to ordered data that progress from low to high (gradient). The palettes names are : Blues, BuGn, BuPu, GnBu, Greens, Greys, Oranges, OrRd, PuBu, PuBuGn, PuRd, Purples, RdPu, Reds, YlGn, YlGnBu YlOrBr, YlOrRd.
- Qualitative palettes (second list of colors), which are best suited to represent nominal or categorical data. They not imply magnitude differences between groups. The palettes names are : Accent, Dark2, Paired, Pastel1, Pastel2, Set1, Set2, Set3.
- Diverging palettes (third list of colors), which put equal emphasis on mid-range critical values and extremes at both ends of the data range. The diverging palettes are : BrBG, PiYG, PRGn, PuOr, RdBu, RdGy, RdYlBu, RdYlGn, Spectral

Blues Greens Greys Oranges Purples Reds

## Palettes in `ggplot2`

```r
scale_colour_brewer(..., type = "seq", palette = 1, direction = 1)
scale_fill_brewer(..., type = "seq", palette = 1, direction = 1)
scale_colour_distiller(..., type = "seq", palette = 1, direction = -1,
¬† values = NULL, space = "Lab", na.value = "grey50",
¬† guide = "colourbar")
scale_fill_distiller(..., type = "seq", palette = 1, direction = -1,
¬† values = NULL, space = "Lab", na.value = "grey50",
¬† guide = "colourbar‚Äù)
d + scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Greens‚Äù)
p + scale_fill_brewer(direction = -1)
```
