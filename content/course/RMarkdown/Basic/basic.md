R Markdown follows the syntax in Pandoc's Markdown

## Lines, paragraphs, headers

* Multiple spaces on a given line are reduced to one
* Line endings with fewer than two spaces are ignored
* Two or more spaces at the end of lines introduce hard breaks, forcing a new line
* Spaces in lines starting with a vertical line | are kept
* Lines starting with the greater-than sign > introduce block quotes
* One or more (multiple blank lines between paragraphs reduce to one) blank lines introduce a new paragraph
* Text with the syntax <!--comments --> is omitted from output
* The number sign # introduces headers; lower levels are created with additional signs â€” up to total five levels
* A pair of single asterisk * or underscores _ introduces italics
* A pair of double asterisk or underscores introduces bold
* These two rules can be combined
* A pair of double tildes ~ introduces strikethrough
