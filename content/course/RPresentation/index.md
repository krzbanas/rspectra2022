## Slides

- Every new slide is created under three dashes (---). 
- A slide can have a few properties, including class and background-image, etc. Properties are written in the beginning of a slide
- Background images can be set via the background-image property. The path should be put inside url()
- There is a special slide, the title slide, that is automatically generated from the YAML metadata of your Rmd document
- You can also disable the automatic title slide via the seal option and create one manually by yourself

## Content Classes

- The default theme of xaringan has provided four more content classes:
- .left-column[ ] and .right-column[ ] provide a sidebar layout. The left sidebar is narrow (20% of the slide width), and the right column is the main column (75% of the slide width). If you have multiple level-2 (##) or level-3 (###) headings in the left column, the last heading will be highlighted, with previous headings being grayed out.
- .pull-left[ ] and .pull-right[ ] provide a two-column layout, and the two columns are of the same width.
