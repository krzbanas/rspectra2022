## Save multiple files with automatic naming

Export every spectrum to single file (automaticaly named) in long format (two columns with many rows - first column wavenumber, second column absorbance, no headers)
PS. If hyperSpec object test have more than 10 spectra first 10 will be exported with this code.

```r

for(i in 1:10)
{ 
  name = paste(i,".","csv", sep = "")
  write.txt.long(test[i,,],file=name, cols = c(".wavelength","spc"),col.names =FALSE)
}
```
