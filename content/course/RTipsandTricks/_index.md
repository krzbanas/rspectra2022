## Save multiple files with automatic naming

```r


all02 <- spc.loess (all01 , seq (7.04, 7.8, 0.001))
all02 <- spc.loess (all01 , seq (7.05, 7.8,  length.out = 400))

all03 <- sweep (all02, 2, mean, "-")

# export every spectrum to single file (automaticaly named) in long format 
# two columns with many rows - first column wavenumber second column absorbance no headers
# if hyperSpec object test have more than 10 spectra first 10 will be exported

for(i in 1:10)
{ 
  name = paste(i,".","csv", sep = "")
  write.txt.long(test[i,,],file=name, cols = c(".wavelength","spc"),col.names =FALSE)
}

```
