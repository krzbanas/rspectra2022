## Use `here` package

```r
library(here)

# specify full path to the data files
data01<-here::here("FOLDER","SUBFOLDER", "file01.csv")
# call the function
dataset01 <- read_csv(data01)
# this code chunk is OS universal
```

`here::here()` figures out the top-level of the current project using some sane heuristics. It looks at working directory, checks a criterion and, if not satisfied, moves up to parent directory and checks again. Lather, rinse, repeat.

Here are the criteria. The order doesnâ€™t really matter because all of them are checked for each directory before moving up to the parent directory:

- Is a file named .here present?
- Is this an RStudio Project? Literally, can I find a file named something like foo.Rproj?
- Is this an R package? Does it have a DESCRIPTION file?
- Is this a remake project? Does it have a file named remake.yml?
- Is this a projectile project? Does it have a file named .projectile?
- Is this a checkout from a version control system? Does it have a directory named .git or .svn? Currently, only Git and Subversion are supported.

If no criteria match, the current working directory will be used as fallback. Use `set_here()` to create an empty .here file that will stop the search if none of the other criteria apply. `dr_here()` will attempt to explain why here decided the root location the way it did. See the function reference for more detail.
